"Bob is tilling a plot of his garden. The plot is 110 feet wide by 120 feet long. His tiller digs a swath two feet wide, and he can till 1 foot of ground in about 2 seconds. How long will it take him to till this plot of land, in minutes?","If Bob goes along the side that's 120 feet long, he will till 110 / 2 = 55 rows.
Each of these rows are 120 feet long, so he will push the tiller a total of 120 * 55 = <<120*55=6600>>6,600 feet.
He tills 1 linear foot of ground every 2 seconds, so it will take him 2 * 6,600 = 13,200 seconds to till this plot
13,200 seconds is 13,2000 / 60 = <<13200/60=220>>220 minutes

"Earl has $90; Fred has $48; Greg has $36. Earl owes Fred $28. Fred owes Greg $32. Greg owes Earl $40. When all debts are paid, how much will Greg and Earl have together in dollars?","Earl will have $90 - $28 = $<<90-28=62>>62 after paying off his debt to Fred.
Fred will have $48 + $28 = $<<48+28=76>>76 after being paid by Earl.
But then Fred will have $76 - $32 = $<<76-32=44>>44 after paying Greg.
Greg will have $36 + $32 = $<<36+32=68>>68 after Fred paid him.
Then, Greg will have $68 - $40 = $<<68-40=28>>28 after paying off his debt to Earl.
Then, Earl will then have $62 + $40 = $<<62+40=102>>102.
So together, Greg and Earl will have $28 + $102 = $<<28+102=130>>130.

"A milk teas shop was able to sell a total of 50 cups of milk tea yesterday. Two-fifths of their sales are winter melon flavor, three-tenths are Okinawa flavor, and the rest are chocolate flavor. How many cups of chocolate-flavored milk tea were they able to sell yesterday?","A milk tea shop sold 50 x 2/5 = <<50*2/5=20>>20 cups of winter melon-flavored milk tea.
They sold 50 x 3/10 = <<50*3/10=15>>15 cups of Okinawa-flavored milk tea.
So they sold a total of 20 + 15 = <<20+15=35>>35 cups of winter melon and Okinawa flavors milk tea.
Therefore, they sold 50 - 35 = <<50-35=15>>15 cups of chocolate-flavored milk tea.

He has 80% of the plates because .8 x 100 = <<.8*100=80>>80
He makes $160 because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160

Alpha Epsilon's running time is 30 minutes less than that of Millennium (which runs for 120 minutes) hence 120-30 = <<120-30=90>>90 minutes
Beast of War: Armoured Command runs for 10 minutes more than Alpha Epsilon hence 90+10 = <<10+90=100>>100 minutes

He did not climb any steps otherwise. In total, how many times has Darry climbed a step today?","Climbing the full ladder means Darry has climbed 11 steps * 10 times = <<11*10=110>>110 steps so far.
On his smaller ladder, he has climbed 6 steps * 7 times = <<6*7=42>>42 steps.

"Hunter needs to make a square patch of land whose perimeter is twice as large as a rectangular patch of land. If the rectangular patch of land has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet, calculate the length of one side of the square patch of land.","If the rectangular patch of land measures 400 feet by 300 feet, the total length around it or its perimeter is given by 2 * 400 + 2 * 300 = 800 + 600 = <<2*400+2*300=1400>>1400
The square patch's perimeter is double that length, so it's 1400 * 2 = <<1400*2=2800>>2800
Since the square has four equal sides, one side of the square patch of land will have a length of 2800/4 = <<2800/4=700>>700 feet

"At Snowflake Plastics, each employee gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.  If Mark uses half his allotment of both types of days in a year, how many hours' worth of days does he have left if each day covers an 8-hour long workday?","First, we add the two types of days together to find 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 days in total between the two types.
We then divide this number in half to find Mark's remaining number of days, getting 20/2= <<10=10>>10 days remaining.
Since each day counts as 8 hours, we multiply 10*8= <<10*8=80>>80 hours' worth of days remaining for Mark.

How much money did Josie have left over after she bought all of the groceries?","The milk cost $4.00 but was on sale for 1/2 off so 4*.50 = $<<4*.50=2.00>>2.00
She bought 2 pounds of bananas at $0.75 per pound so 2 *.75 = $<<2*0.75=1.50>>1.50
She had a $1.25 coupon off of laundry detergent so 10.25 - 1.25 = $<<10.25-1.25=9.00>>9.00
